![partial screenshot from website](/src/images/readme.png)

---

This is my personal portfolio, built with React.  A Simple, single web-page application, using the following technologies:

* React
* React-Router-Dom
* Bootstrap components
* Gh-pages

##  Portfolio

The Portfolio link will lead to several projects I have put togethor over the past 6 months.  Each project is linked to the deployed
site, as well as my GitHub repo.

## Contact

The contact page is a work in progress.  It is built with the useState hook to display real time updates of input fields.  The form currently does not submit, this functionality will be added at another time.  A live email link is provided at the bottom of this page.

## Resume

Please review my linked resume too!
